## MERN Stack Project

This project aims to utilise node.js and express to build a REST api which will link to MongoDB Atlas as a database. I have also utilised additional technologies such as Mongoose to ensure the data that is being uploaded meets certain criteria based on a models and schemas. 
The Front End is built with React. 

## Proxy

There is a proxy in my package.json for my frontend so that I can run my backend and frontend both on local servers on my computer. I am aware that having this proxy would not be common practice in a professional development setting.
